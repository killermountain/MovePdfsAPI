This will be to ensure that the discharge planning from the inpatient bed is commenced as soon as the patient is admitted. This is to ensuring that all patients admitted to hospital will have a comprehensive, individually designed care plan. Care plans should be designed in collaboration with the patient/carer in order that they can understand why they have been admitted, and their future plan of care. In order to allow patients to make the necessary arrangements, discussion of an expected date of discharge (EDD) should commence on admission and be updated regularly to the patient/carer"
